# Scientific-Notation-Converter

This is the first app I made in Swift! It can convert a number from decimal notation to scientific notation and vice versa. In creating this app, I learned about how to manage user input and how to reformat numbers to display properly in text fields. I also studied how to add constraints to the objects on my Storyboard (what the user sees) so that the items on the screen were shown properly regardless of the type of phone the user had.
