# Scientific-Notation-Converter

This is the first app I made in Swift! It can convert a number from decimal notation to scientific notation and vice versa using user input, which can include negative decimals and exponents. It also resizes its textFields appropriately when the user inputs larger numbers in order to make them visible.

In creating this app, I learned about how to manage user input and how to reformat numbers to display properly in text fields. I also studied how to add constraints to the objects on my Storyboard (what the user sees) so that the items on the screen were shown properly regardless of the type of phone the user had. Finally, I learned how to write tests for my app to ensure that it was working properly.

If I were to work more on this project, I would add a slider so that the user would not have to type in exponents. This would not only more effectively prevent the user from not entering decimals as exponents (currently, I made the user custom keyboards without decimals), but also keep the exponents within a range, as too-large exponents make calculations less precise. I would also display error messages if the user's input was out of range or if the output was less precise.
